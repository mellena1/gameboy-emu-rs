# gameboy-emu-rs

A Gameboy emulator written in Rust. The goal of this project isn't to write the most feature rich emulator or even the most accurate emulator. This is exclusively a learning exercise for myself to learn more about emulation and the Rust language.

## Goals/Milestones
(These will be updated as I learn more about the internals of the Gameboy)

- [ ] Implement all CPU instructions
- [ ] Implement GPU
- [ ] Pass [Blargg's hardware test ROMs](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms)
- [ ] Implement sound
- [ ] Implement a simple desktop GUI
- [ ] Successfully boot the boot ROM
- [ ] Implement passing actions/controls to the emulator
- [ ] Play a game
- [ ] Compile to WASM
- [ ] Add GBC support?
